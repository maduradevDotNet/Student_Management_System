## 🛠️ Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline Setup

This project uses Jenkins for continuous integration and delivery. The pipeline is configured to automatically:

1. **Build** the ASP.NET project
2. **Run tests** to ensure code quality
3. **Deploy** the application if all tests pass

### Jenkinsfile Configuration

Add a `Jenkinsfile` to your project root:

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                script {
                    bat 'dotnet build'
                }
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                script {
                    bat 'dotnet test'
                }
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            when {
                branch 'main'
            }
            steps {
                echo 'Deploying application...'
                // Deployment steps here
            }
